# Polymorphism

Area calculation was made in an application that will consist of Square, Rectangle, Right Triangle objects.

Classes were used to produce each of the objects we mentioned above.

---Square

---Rectangle

---Right Triangle

Our classes were collected under a common roof and derived from the BaseGeometricShape class.

Properties for BaseGeometricShape -> Width and Height

Since the Area() method will be found in all geometric shapes, it was defined in the Base Class.

The area calculated as Width x Height for Square and Rectangle was calculated as (Width x Height) / 2 for Right Triangle.

The relevant application was coded using the Polymorphism principle. An example object was created from each class and the area measurements were printed to the console screen.
